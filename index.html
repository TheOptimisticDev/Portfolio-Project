                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I hold a certificate in Software Engineering Front-end from ALX Africa, with a professional background spanning 8 years in safety and security.
                    I made a deliberate shift to IT and software engineering, fueled by my passion for technology and a constant drive to expand my skills.<br><br>
                    Recently, I achieved a significant milestone by completing a Strategic Learning Program (SLP) at the University of Johannesburg, specializing in Artificial Intelligence within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). 
                    This aligns seamlessly with my keen interest in the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, I am concurrently enrolled in the Google IT Support Professional program on Coursera, where I am enhancing my expertise in IT support.
                    My commitment extends to obtaining further certifications to solidify and broaden my knowledge base.<br><br>
                    I am proud to have successfully completed the AWS Skills Center program, specifically "Becoming a Cloud Practitioner Parts 1-3 & Lab Session." Furthermore, I recently concluded a rewarding internship at CodeClause, gaining valuable hands-on experience in the field.<br><br>
                    My foundation in Software Engineering from ALX Africa, combined with the practical insights gained from the Coursera program, AWS Skills Center, and internship at CodeClause, has equipped me with a comprehensive skill set. This diverse set of experiences positions me to effectively tackle the myriad challenges within the tech industry.<br><br>
                    I am genuinely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and remain dedicated to making a meaningful impact. My commitment to continuous learning and knowledge expansion underscores my determination to contribute even more effectively in the evolving landscape of technology.
